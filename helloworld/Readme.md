# Go Hello World Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Go Hello World project, along with explanations of key concepts.

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: Contains the main Go program that prints "Hello, World" to the console.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/helloworld.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd helloworld
    ```

3. **Run the Hello World program:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    You should see the output:
    ```
    Hello, World
    ```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Go Modules

The project utilizes Go modules for dependency management. The `go mod init` command initializes a new Go module, and the resulting `go.mod` file specifies the module name and Go version.

### 2. `main` Function

In Go, the `main` function serves as the entry point of execution for the program. The `main.go` file contains the `main` function where the "Hello, World" message is printed.

### 3. `Println`
Println formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to standard output. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline is appended. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.


### 4. Running a Go Program

The `go run` command compiles and runs the Go program specified after it. In this case, it executes the `main.go` file, resulting in the "Hello, World" output.
